# Get-Outside (GO) Camping Blog
---
## Background
My family and I used to go camping fairly often, and this blog would be a great way to share the places we've been with others, as well as discover new places we haven't yet been from other people.

## The GO Camping Blog App

### Next Steps
Below are list of features I'd like to add in the future:
- Google Maps showing the location of the campgrounds in the DB
- Allow people to comment to other people's comments
- Have the campgrounds listed in a sortable and filterable table
- Have users be able to rate the campgrounds, and have an overall average display
- Have users be able to share a campground with friends/family not yet members of the app
